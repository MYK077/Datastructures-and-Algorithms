# Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
# bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
# Given input matrix =
# [
#   [ 5, 1, 9,11],
#   [ 2, 4, 8,10],
#   [13, 3, 6, 7],
#   [15,14,12,16]
# ],
#
# rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
# [
#   [15,13, 2, 5],
#   [14, 3, 4, 1],
#   [12, 6, 8, 9],
#   [16, 7,10,11]
# ]
